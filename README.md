# Python for Everybody Specialization - Hands-On Labs

This Specialization builds on the success of the Python for Everybody course and will introduce fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language. In the Capstone Project, youâ€™ll use the technologies learned throughout the Specialization to design and create your own applications for data retrieval, processing, and visualization.

## Course 1: Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)

### Practice Questions

1. **Installing Python and Writing Your First Program**
    - Install Python on your computer and write a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

2. **Basic Python Syntax**
    - Write a program that asks the user for their name and age, then prints a message saying, "Hello [name], you are [age] years old."

3. **Using Variables**
    - Create a program that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. (Formula: F = C * 9/5 + 32)

4. **Functions and Loops**
    - Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers.
    - Create a loop that prints all the even numbers from 1 to 100.

### Real-World Problem

## Course 2: Python Data Structures

### Practice Questions

1. **Principles of Data Structures**
    - Write a program that reads a list of integers and prints the largest and smallest numbers in the list.

2. **Reading and Writing Data from Files**
    - Create a program that reads a text file and counts the number of lines, words, and characters.

3. **Using Dictionaries**
    - Write a program that takes a sentence as input and counts the frequency of each word using a dictionary.

4. **Working with Tuples**
    - Create a program that takes a list of tuples (name, age) and sorts them by age.

### Real-World Problem

- <button style="background-color:#2196F3; color: white; border: none; padding: 10px 24px;">Implement a Student Grades Management System</button>

  Implement a student grades management system. The system should be able to:
  - Add new student records with their names and grades.
  - Update the grades of existing students.
  - Calculate and display the average grade of the class.
  - Save the student records to a file and load them from a file.

## Course 3: Using Python to Access Web Data

### Practice Questions

1. **Using Regular Expressions**
    - Write a program that extracts all the email addresses from a given text using regular expressions.

2. **Understanding Web Protocols**
    - Create a program that retrieves and displays the HTML content of a web page given its URL.

3. **Retrieving Data from Websites and APIs**
    - Write a program that retrieves weather data from an API and displays the current temperature and weather conditions for a given city.

4. **Working with XML Data**
    - Create a program that parses an XML file and extracts specific information, such as the titles and authors of books in a library catalog.

### Real-World Problem

- <button style="background-color:#f44336; color: white; border: none; padding: 10px 24px;">Develop a Web Scraper</button>

  Develop a web scraper that collects data from an e-commerce website. The program should retrieve product names, prices, and ratings, then save this data to a CSV file.

## Course 4: Using Databases with Python

### Practice Questions

1. **CRUD Operations**
    - Write a program that creates a SQLite database and a table for storing employee information (name, age, position). Perform basic CRUD operations: add, read, update, and delete records.

2. **Object-Oriented Python**
    - Create a class representing a book with attributes for title, author, and ISBN. Implement methods to display book details and to check if two books are the same based on their ISBN.

3. **Storing Data Across Multiple Tables**
    - Design a database schema with two tables: one for customers and one for orders. Implement a program to add customers and orders, and retrieve orders for a specific customer.

4. **Using Google Maps API**
    - Write a program that takes a list of addresses, retrieves their geographical coordinates using the Google Maps API, and displays them on a map.

### Real-World Problem

- <button style="background-color:#ff9800; color: white; border: none; padding: 10px 24px;">Develop a Contact Management System</button>

  Develop a contact management system where users can add, update, delete, and search for contacts. Each contact should have a name, phone number, email, and address. Use a SQLite database to store the contacts and implement a user-friendly interface for managing them.

## Course 5: Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python

### Practice Questions

1. **Using Unicode Characters and Strings**
    - Write a program that takes a string containing unicode characters and counts the occurrences of each character.

2. **Building a Search Engine**
    - Create a simple search engine that indexes a set of documents and allows users to search for keywords. The program should return the documents containing the keywords.

3. **Selecting and Processing Data**
    - Write a program that reads data from a CSV file, processes it (e.g., filters rows, calculates statistics), and saves the processed data to a new CSV file.

4. **Creating Email Data Visualizations**
    - Develop a program that reads email data (e.g., from a CSV file) and generates visualizations such as histograms of email frequencies by sender and time of day.

### Real-World Problem

- <button style="background-color:#9c27b0; color: white; border: none; padding: 10px 24px;">Implement a Complete Data Pipeline</button>

  Implement a complete data pipeline that retrieves data from an API (e.g., Twitter API), processes the data to extract useful information (e.g., sentiment analysis of tweets), stores the data in a database, and visualizes the results using graphs and charts. For example, you could analyze the sentiment of tweets mentioning a specific topic over time and display the results on a dashboard.
